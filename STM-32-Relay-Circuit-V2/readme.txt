I might have not set up timers properly

Take care to use generated code comments properly

for reference STM32F407VGTx, x=6 or 7
    6 = Industrial temperature range, -40...+85°C
    7 = Industrial temperature range, -40...+105°C
    
variable names so confusing
three different variations

old mcu stm32 cubeide
new mcu stm32 cubeide
new kicanvas pcb 


*** I AM ASSUMING BMS_OUT1 is old BMS_OK
